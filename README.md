Responsive, mobile-first contact-form (HTML, CSS + Bootstrap)

The project was built with the following `user stories` by freeCodeCamp: [Build a Survey Form](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-survey-form)

## Motivation

I built the project for learning purposes, my main goal was to practice creating responsive layouts.
